#### Create a coupon

You can create coupons easily via the [coupon management](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons) page of the Stripe dashboard. Coupon creation is also accessible via the API if you need to create coupons on the fly.

A coupon has either a `percent_off` or an `amount_off` and `currency`. If you set an `amount_off`, that amount will be subtracted from any invoice's subtotal. For example, an invoice with a subtotal of $10 will have a final total of $0 if a coupon with an `amount_off` of 2000 is applied to it and an invoice with a subtotal of $30 will have a final total of $10 if a coupon with an `amount_off` of 2000 is applied to it.
