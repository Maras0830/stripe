## Setup

### Installation

Cartalyst packages utilize [Composer](http://getcomposer.org), for more information on how to install Composer please read the [Composer Documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).

Open your terminal and run the following:

```
composer require cartalyst/stripe:^2.0
```

Now you are able to require the `vendor/autoload.php` file to autoload the package.

> **Note:** If you're using a modern PHP framework like Laravel, the autoload file will be most likely automatically included for you.
